Teletubbies is a desktop app for telemarketers and their supervisors to manage their customer lists.

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Teletubbies` to emulate a friendly assistant to telemarketers.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Teletubbies Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w15-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
